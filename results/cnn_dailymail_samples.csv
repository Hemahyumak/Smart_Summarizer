"Down Augusta way they say the azaleas are in full bloom, which is more than can be said for England’s Justin Rose. A bruising Florida swing last month saw the Englishman fall outside the world’s top 10. For a player who has been virtually a fixture in the top five for the last three years it was certainly a dent to the ego, with the Masters now just around the corner. Rose’s solution to his miserable form — three missed cuts and a 55th-place finish at the Cadillac Championship in four PGA Tour starts — was the time-honoured one. For the past two weeks, the 34-year-old has spent long hours on the practice ground. Justin Rose hit 17 out of 18 greens in regulation and signed for a 69 at the Shell Houston Open . In the first round of the Shell Houston Open on Thursday there were encouraging signs his decline will prove temporary. Rose hit 17 out of 18 greens in regulation and signed for a 69, the same score as his playing partner, the ever- consistent Jordan Spieth. ‘It’s certainly a welcome return to the sixties, for it had been a while,’ said Rose, smiling. On a day when American Scott Piercy went round in 63 and Phil Mickelson enjoyed his best round in months with a 66, it was hardly surprising the only reporter waiting to talk to Rose was this one. But under the radar is never a bad place to be going to the Masters. The boom and bust years that characterised the first half of Rose’s career meant there was never going to be any feelings of panic following his unusually poor run in the Sunshine State. ‘There’s no doubt I lost my game there but the Florida swing can be unforgiving if you’re slightly off,’ he said. ‘Over the past two weeks I feel like I’ve done some good work and whether I finish well or not here I feel like I’m going in the right direction again. ‘Basically I was getting ahead of the ball at impact, and shots were going left or right, the irons were not solid and the new putter was not working. So we’ve corrected the faults and I’ve gone back to the old putter.’ Phil Mickelson enjoyed his best round in months with a 66 on Thursday . Does he pay much attention to the world rankings? ‘You notice, for sure,’ he said. ‘I’m very proud of the fact I’ve been in the world’s top five for practically the whole of the last three years. It’s a nice ego thing, so by the end of the year I’m hoping there won’t be any slippage. ‘But right now, I’ve got to focus on my game in the knowledge that the rankings change fast when you’re playing well. I’m in all the tournaments I want to be in, so there’s no need to worry on that score. Typically, your good years are built around four or five really good weeks, so you have to stay patient.’ He’d certainly love for one of those good weeks to be the next one. Rose paid a reconnaissance visit to Augusta last Monday and felt the same old thrill. ‘It’s such a treat to enjoy it when it is quiet, you still pinch yourself,’ he said. ‘I think if I’d had a crystal ball when I was 13 or 14 and it had said I’d get to play Augusta every year, I’d have been very happy with that.’ He’s certainly had his share of adventures during his nine appearances to date. Rose might be the only player in Masters history to have led or had a share of the lead after every round bar the last one. His best chance so far of finishing on top after 72 holes came in 2007, when he stood on the 17th hole tied for the lead only to run up a fatal double-bogey six. Paul Casey celebrated his last-gasp Masters invitation with two eagle threes in a fine round of 68 . ‘The Masters has probably been less on my mind this year because I am trying to find some form,’ he admitted. ‘But I think the fact I’ve had a number of great rounds there will always stand me in good stead. Regardless of what happens here, I feel comfortable on that course and know I can manage my game even if it’s not 100 per cent. You draw off the energy of the place.’ Mickelson has certainly done that over the years and perhaps the veteran lefty, a three-time Masters champion, is gearing himself up for another run at the green jacket. ‘It was a good start to the tournament and now I’m looking for three more good rounds,’ he said. 'This is a big week for me. I felt the game was close last week. The only thing missing was chipping and short game.' Paul Casey, like Mickelson another former winner of this event, celebrated his last-gasp Masters invitation with a fine round of 68 notable for two eagle threes. In the afternoon wave, Padraig Harrington and Lee Westwood both made good starts to play their first six holes in two under.","Justin Rose bounced back from Florida misery by carding 69 in Houston .

"There was no special treatment for Lewis Ferguson at Paul Nicholls’ yard on Thursday morning. The 18-year-old was mucking out the stables as usual, just a cut on the nose to show for the fall which has made him an internet sensation. Ferguson, whose double somersault horror fall from the favourite Merrion Square in the 4.20pm at Wincanton on Wednesday has been watched hundreds of thousands of times online. But he was back riding out and said he was undeterred from getting back in the sadal. ‘It was just a blur,’ he said, ‘I couldn’t work out what had happened until I got back to the weighing room and watched the replay. All the other jockeys asked me if I was alright and stuff, they all watched with me and looked away in horror. It’s about the most impressive fall I’ve seen.

"When emergency crews received a call saying 'someone' had been knocked down by a car in Essex, they immediately sent two ambulances to the rescue.

"(CNN)Sunday's announcement that Corinthian Colleges Inc. would shut down all of its remaining 28 campuses is a positive development in a long struggle to hold for-profit colleges accountable. Corinthian, which once enrolled more than 70,000 students, is one of the worst of the ""predator colleges"" -- schools that offer dubious degrees, saddle students with high amounts of debt and gobble up tens of billions of dollars in federal money every year. Many of these schools are for-profit career colleges that operate mostly online. It's no wonder that Corinthian is doing this after the U.S. Department of Education curtailed its access to federal student aid last summer. There are about 1.3 million students enrolled in for-profit colleges, many of which have questionable track records, and their students need help transitioning into legitimate postsecondary schools. With Uncle Sam's student loan debt sheet topping $1 trillion, we literally can't afford to continue funding for-profit colleges -- which reportedly get 86% of their funding from federal student loan money. For those not familiar with the for-profit college fiasco, here's the whole story in one telling statistic: While for-profit colleges enroll only 13% of the nation's college students, such colleges account for nearly half of all student loan defaults, according to Department of Education statistics. For comparison's sake, the default rate of for-profit college students is worse than the default rate of the worst subprime borrowers during the financial crisis. How do these colleges operate? It's deviously simple: Convince low-income students into borrowing tens of thousands of dollars through easy federal student loans, keep costs low through online classes and part-time professors, and watch the money roll in. The aggressive tactics of these colleges boggle the mind. Recruiters are told to make 100 phone calls and leave 100 messages a day, according to a ProPublica investigation. I can personally attest to the aggressive tactics. My phone number was accidentally placed on a call list for a for-profit college recently, and I received so many calls per day that I had to ask my wireless carrier to block the phone number. Stopping the exploitation of students isn't easy. The for-profit college business is a multibillion-dollar industry. The CEOs of these companies make millions of dollars a year, employ an army of lobbyists and donate money to both political parties. But the past two months brought a new twist to the crisis. Hundreds of graduates of the now-defunct Corinthian joined a ""debt strike,"" publicly declaring their refusal to pay back their loans. In response, Education Department Secretary Arne Duncan signaled a willingness to forgive loans of Corinthian graduates who have crushing debt and no job prospects. Now that Corinthian is finally shutting down, we must finish the job. The remaining for-profit colleges should be closed. Any student not gainfully employed or transferred to a reputable college within three years should be considered a victim, and their debts should be forgiven. Yes, ""victim"" is the right word. If these degrees actually helped people get jobs, we should be celebrating them. But according to a jaw-dropping report by the Education Department, the average graduate of an online for-profit college makes less than a high school dropout. Not the equivalent of a high school dropout. Less than a high school dropout. The real-life misery caused by predatory colleges is painful to hear about. One Corinthian graduate has $37,000 in debt for his computer science degree, but he can't even get a job at Best Buy, according to Slate. Another graduate, $33,000 in debt, has a medical assisting degree, but she gave up on finding employment in her field. She waits tables now, The Chronicle of Higher Education says. I can already hear your next question. If for-profit colleges are this terrible, are they at least cheaper? No. In fact, their cost is reportedly around 60% higher than a comparable degree from a public college. What's even more frustrating is that we've known about the shenanigans of these predator colleges for years. A 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office found widespread rule breaking by the largest for-profit colleges -- everything from accepting fictitious high-school diplomas to encouraging plagiarism and cheating. In one example, an undercover federal investigator posing as a student was told by a professor, ""It's not hard to get a 100% on the second try; just jot down the correct answers and take the quiz again,"" according to The New York Times. In 2013, Career Education Corp. paid $10 million to settle charges by the state of New York regarding phony job-placement claims. All told, no fewer than 36 state attorneys general were investigating for-profit colleges in 2014. After selling off 95 of its campuses last year, Corinthian said on Sunday that it tried unsuccessfully to sell the remaining 28 campuses, blaming the failure on ""federal and state regulators seeking to impose financial penalties and conditions"" on potential buyers. You can't hide your bad behavior forever, and the questionable practices of many for-profit colleges are starting to catch up with them. Enrollment at the University of Phoenix -- the largest for-profit college in the United States -- has fallen by half, to about 213,000. We laid the smackdown on predatory lenders during the financial crisis, and it's time to do the same thing with for-profit colleges. To keep predator colleges from wrecking our faith in the college degree -- still the best pathway to a middle-class life -- we need to act now. For-profit colleges have flunked their final exam. Now it's up to their rich benefactor, Uncle Sam, to make sure they don't go back to school in the fall. Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article said the San Diego campus of the University of Phoenix had been banned from enrolling military veterans last year; that issue has been resolved.","David Wheeler: Corinthian, considered a ""predator"" school, will shut down campuses .
Wheeler: Students of for-profit colleges are hapless victims; their debts should be forgiven .","(CNN)Sunday's announcement that Corinthian Colleges Inc. would shut down all of its remaining 28 campuses is a positive development in a long struggle to hold for-profit colleges accountable. Corinthian, which once enrolled more than 70,000 students, is one of the worst of the ""predator colleges"" -- schools that offer dubious degrees, saddle students with high amounts of debt and gobble up tens of billions of dollars in federal money every year. Many of these schools are for-profit career colleges that operate mostly online. It's no wonder that Corinthian is doing this after the U.S. Department of Education curtailed its access to federal student aid last summer. There are about 1.3 million students enrolled in for-profit colleges, many of which have questionable track records, and their students need help transitioning into legitimate postsecondary schools. With Uncle Sam's student loan debt sheet topping $1 trillion, we literally can't afford to continue funding for-profit colleges -- which reportedly get 86% of their funding from federal student loan money. For those not familiar with the for-profit college fiasco, here's the whole story in one telling statistic: While for-profit colleges enroll only 13% of the nation's college students, such colleges account for nearly half of all student loan defaults, according to Department of Education statistics. For comparison's sake, the default rate of for-profit college students is worse than the default rate of the worst subprime borrowers during the financial crisis. How do these colleges operate? It's deviously simple: Convince low-income students into borrowing tens of thousands of dollars through easy federal student loans, keep costs low through online classes and part-time professors, and watch the money roll in. The aggressive tactics of these colleges boggle the mind. Recruiters are told to make 100 phone calls and leave 100 messages a day, according to a ProPublica investigation. I can personally attest to the aggressive tactics. My phone number was accidentally placed on a call list for a for-profit college recently, and I received so many calls per day that I had to ask my wireless carrier to block the phone number. Stopping the exploitation of students isn't easy. The for-profit college business is a multibillion-dollar industry. The CEOs of these companies make millions of dollars a year, employ an army of lobbyists and donate money to both political parties. But the past two months brought a new twist to the crisis. Hundreds of graduates of the now-defunct Corinthian joined a ""debt strike,"" publicly declaring their refusal to pay back their loans. In response, Education Department Secretary Arne Duncan signaled a willingness to forgive loans of Corinthian graduates who have crushing debt and no job prospects. Now that Corinthian is finally shutting down, we must finish the job. The remaining for-profit colleges should be closed. Any student not gainfully employed or transferred to a reputable college within three years should be considered a victim, and their debts should be forgiven. Yes, ""victim"" is the right word. If these degrees actually helped people get jobs, we should be celebrating them. But according to a jaw-dropping report by the Education Department, the average graduate of an online for-profit college makes less than a high school dropout. Not the equivalent of a high school dropout. Less than a high school dropout. The real-life misery caused by predatory colleges is painful to hear about. One Corinthian graduate has $37,000 in debt for his computer science degree, but he can't even get a job at Best Buy, according to Slate. Another graduate, $33,000 in debt, has a medical assisting degree, but she gave up on finding employment in her field. She waits tables now, The Chronicle of Higher Education says. I can already hear your next question. If for-profit colleges are this terrible, are they at least cheaper? No. In fact, their cost is reportedly around 60% higher than a comparable degree from a public college. What's even more frustrating is that we've known about the shenanigans of these predator colleges for years. A 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office found widespread rule breaking by the largest for-profit colleges -- everything from accepting fictitious high-school diplomas to encouraging plagiarism and cheating. In one example, an undercover federal investigator posing as a student was told by a professor, ""It's not har","Cynthia Schneider: Corinthian Colleges shutting down is a positive development.

"Boston (CNN)The Boston Marathon is traditionally an event in which people in and around the Massachusetts capital come together, celebrate and enjoy. But not in 2013, when three people died and over 200 were injured when a pair of bombs went off within 12 seconds of each other at the finish line. And not this year -- at least not if you're a member of the jury that convicted Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in the bombings. That's what federal Judge George A.

A look at all of the charges . The only question now, short of a successful appeal of that verdict, is what price he'll now pay. The maximum penalty for several of the charges is death. Talking to the jury on Tuesday, O'Toole predicted that the sentencing phase will last four weeks before cautioning that forecasting a specific timetable is less reliable than guessing the weather. The plan is for the court to be in session for four days a week, as long as the process takes. Until then, O'Toole told the jurors, ""Please put the case out of your minds. Enjoy the warm weather.""

"Vowing to cling on: Liberal Democrats leader Nick Clegg makes a speech during a General Election campaign visit to Sutton in south London yesterday . Nick Clegg yesterday vowed to cling on as Liberal Democrat leader even if the party is wiped out at the polls. Friends of the Deputy Prime Minister have previously indicated that he will quit as leader if the Lib Dems are reduced to fewer than 30 MPs, while sources have also suggested he will go if the party is left out of power after the election.

"Paul Gregory, 51, of Bedford, has been fined £795 for having a blue badge, claiming he could only walk 200 metres, when in fact he was a keen walker . A disability badge holder who claimed he could only walk 200 metres ended up in court after council officials noticed a newspaper report recounting his exploits on a 191-mile hike.

"Apple offers a range of ways to unlock its devices from PINs to passwords and fingerprints. But you could soon use a selfie to gain access to your apps and messages thanks to Apple's latest patent. The filing details a system of scanning a user's face with the front-facing camera when the handset is moved into a certain position, and automatically unlocking the device if the image matches one on file. The patent (illustrated) was filed by the California-based firm in March 2011 and awarded earlier this week. It details a method of scanning a user's face using the front-facing camera each time the phone is moved into a certain position. If the scanned face matches a previously taken photo, the phone unlocks automatically . The patent was filed by the Californian tech giant in March 2011 and awarded earlier this week. Called 'Locking and unlocking a mobile device using facial recognition', the patent explains that current methods of unlocking a device are 'inconvenient and time consuming'. Apple's patent details a method for automatically unlocking a mobile device using a system comprising of 'capturing an initial image  while the device is locked, monitoring a motion state of the mobile device to determine whether the device is moving or is motionless;  analysing the images to detect a user's face and unlocking the device.' Android Lollipop users already have an almost identical feature known as Trusted face in the Smart Lock menu. It is an extension of Face Unlock that launched on Android Ice Cream Sandwich. Once the screen is enabled and the camera is held in front of the face, the screen automatically unlocks. This relies on the user pressing the power button to enable the screen. By comparison it appears that Apple's proposed system would track the movement of the phone to determine whether it is being used, or is placed flat on a table.

It will only unlock if the angle of the face matches, or is similar to, the one that was initially taken to avoid the phone unlocking simply when the phone is near a face. As Apple explained: 'In one embodiment, the image is analysed for a facial profile of a human face, without regard to a specific user.

'In this case, the device will only need to determine that a human facial profile is present.' It continued that once an allotted period of time has elapsed and a user's face is not detected in any of the images, the device stays locked.

'The predetermined facial profile may be determined from an image that was previously captured by the device's camera and stored in a storage of images of authorised users.' Chip maker Qualcomm has unveiled its Sense ID 3D fingerprint scanner - the first biometric sensor using ultrasonic technology. It uses ultrasonic sound waves to capture the ridges, sweat pores and more on the tip of a finger in greater detail than capacitive touch ID sensors seen on the likes of Apple and Samsung devices. This not only makes it more accurate than other sensors, but it will also work even if the user’s hands are wet or have dirt or lotions on it, for example. Phones running Sense ID are expected to launch later this year, but Qualcomm did not reveal to MailOnline which devices or manufacturers it is working with. The patent also suggests this feature could be used by multiple users, in the way that multiple fingerprints can be added to its current Touch ID system. 'In this case, the database of images of authorised users would contain an image for each  user,' it added. 'To match a facial profile in the subsequent image, the device would have to compare the subsequent image to each image in the database. 'Furthermore, each authorised user may have an associated unlocking profile in the database that indicates what functions or applications of the device are enabled when the device is unlocked.' Phone makers are looking for alternative ways to secure devices while making them faster and more convenient to open. For example, Fujitsu recently demonstrated its iris scanning prototype that lets people access phones, apps and online accounts by staring at an infrared sensor. This would work in a similar way to facial recognition, but is more secure and unique to an individual user.

"Veteran actor Robert Hardy is selling his enormous collection of antiques in a £100,000 auction after deciding to downsize his home. The star, known for appearing in All Creatures Great and Small and playing Winston Churchill several times, is auctioning off more than 200 items he has collected over his career. Mr Hardy, 89, is a keen military historian who studied English with J.R.R. Tolkien and is now an expert on the medieval longbow. Sale: Actor Robert Hardy is selling off his collection of antiques including a diorama of the Battle of Agincourt . Cabinets: A pair of early Victorian items of furniture made by Gillows of Lancaster which are set to fetch up to £4,000 at the auction on Saturday . Portrait: A painting of Mr Hardy holding a longbow, reflecting his interest in medieval history . One of the most unusual items featured in the auction of his possessions is a hand-painted limewood diorama depicted the progress of the Battle of Agincourt in 3D. The piece was created by artist L.M. Rendall in the 1960s after being commissioned by Mr Hardy himself, and has an estimate of £4,000 to £6,000. There is also a longbow made from yew with a mother-of-pearl handle, as well as a portrait of Mr Hardy holding the bow, which is set to sell for up to £2,000. The actor is also selling paintings, furniture, swords, flintlock rifles, silverware and a fine collection of crystal chandeliers. Diorama: The 3D model was commissioned specially by Mr Hardy from artist L.M. Rendall in the 1960s . Close-up: The piece was rendered in amazing detail showing the progress of the battle in 1415 . Luxurious: A view of many of the items of furniture and other antiques which are being sold . Dozens of books, some dating back to the 17th century, are included in the auction which is set to take place this Saturday.

"Fenerbahce have called for the suspension of the Turkish championship following the gun attack on their team bus on Saturday. The bus came under armed attack as it drove to the airport following an away match at Caykur Rizespor in Turkey's Super Lig. Fener said on their official website the bus driver was wounded in the attack and taken to hospital and there was no mention of any injuries to anyone else.

The injured driver, with blood seeping from a head wound, seeks help  after the attack . A statement on the club's official website on Sunday said: 'We consider that as long as this attack is not solved in a way that satisfies Fenerbahce and public opinion, a suspension of the championship is inevitable. 'Blood ran and football was silenced. Finding and punishing the culprits is of vital importance for Fenerbahce.' Following the incident, Fener midfielder Mehmet Topal told Sky News: 'We cheated death. God protect us. I hope our driver will be all right. Words fail me. It's unbelievable.'

"The mother of a mentally ill daughter who killed herself last month has revealed how her condition worsened over years and eventually drove her to suicide. Doris Fuller's daughter, Natalie, 28, suffered from bipolar disorder and psychosis, and died when she stepped in front of a train in Baltimore, Maryland, last month. And in the wake of her death, Fuller has written about how her illness, which went undiagnosed until her early 20s, and said she was 'the bravest person I have ever known'. Scroll down for video . Opening up: Doris Fuller's daughter Natalie, left with her mom, killed herself last month - and now Fuller has opened up about how Natalie's bipolar disorder and psychosis led to her death . The mother and daughter pair had shot to fame in 2004 when they collaborated on a parenting guide based on Natalie being totally honest with her mother about whatever she was asked. Bestseller: Natalie opened up to her mom - and the result was this popular parenting book . In a long article about her daughter's life for the Washington Post, Fuller wrote how their famously close relationship was changed for good when Natalie had her first psychotic episode at the age of 22, after she had left for college. Fuller wrote: 'In the span of a few weeks she went from being a dazzling young adult with the world at her feet to a psych-ward patient with an arrest record.' Summarizing her last years, she said: 'My daughter lived more than six years with an incurable disease that filled her head with devils that literally hounded her to death, and she did it while laughing, painting, writing poetry, advocating and bringing joy to the people around her. 'She was the bravest person I have ever known, and her suicide doesn’t change that.' And though medicines and proper treatment gave Natalie her life back for a time, she eventually decided to stop taking her meds, which brought her troubles back, even more acute than before. In a mental health documentary video filmed in 2014, Natalie described the worst lows of her condition, in which she said terrifyingly real voices would tell her to hurt herself. She told the cameras: 'I believed that everything happening to me was real, and I thought that I was acting fine. 'But my mom and my brother and everyone around me could see something that I couldn't see. 'Even though [the voices] were telling me to hurt myself and do horrible things to myself, I still listened to them because I had a relationship with them. I thought they were real.' Although Natalie, a keen artist who sculpted, painted and wrote poetry, often seemed fine while on medication, Fuller told how her future seemed a little bleaker every time she relapsed. Difficulties: Natalie (left in 2014) was not diagnosed with a mental health problem until she was 22 - before then she had a regular childhood (right). She told how as she grew older voices started telling her to harm herself . Growing up: As a teenager, Natalie's no-holds-barred honesty helped make her mom a bestseller . She wrote: 'If she even inadvertently missed a few days of medication - even while receiving therapy and other forms of treatment - the demons would return, and one of the first things they would tell her was to stop taking her medicine. 'The second thing they would tell her was not to talk to her mom, the most powerful other influence in her life. 'Each time she obeyed and relapsed, she plunged into a longer free fall, hitting the ground harder, recovering more slowly and returning at a lower plateau.' According to the article, the final, ultimately fatal, change came last fall when Natalie concluded that the drugs were not helping her at all, and gave them up for good. Fuller was not specific about what happened in Natalie's last weeks, though in a post on a tribute site to her daughter, she mentioned that she had holidayed in Nicaragua with members of her family in February.

"So, once again, it will all come down to the actions of a man from Salto. On this occasion, though, the focus will not be on Salto’s most famous son. Luis Suarez will be at the Parc des Princes tonight, forming one part of football’s most famous three-man attack, looking to fire Barcelona into the Champions League semi-finals. Usually when they reach this stage, Barcelona do not make any mistakes. Standing on the other side of the pitch will be someone who Suarez knows inside out, a player who hails from his home city in Uruguay and with whom he has shared a number of big nights when representing their country. Edinson Cavani prepares for Paris Saint-Germain's quarter-final clash with Barcelona . PSG train at Camp-des-Loges in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, west of Paris . Cavani celebrates scoring for the Paris side in the League Cup final last weekend . Edinson Cavani knows the spotlight will be shining on him this evening. If Paris Saint-Germain are to break through the glass ceiling and progress beyond the Champions League’s last eight, Cavani – a player known as El Matador – must torment the stars from Catalonia. The onus falls on Cavani for a number of reasons. First, PSG have been stripped by suspension of two key players, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marco Veratti, the product of that ugly last 16 success against Chelsea; Thiago Motta is injured, while David Luiz is also a major doubt. Yet there is more to it than that. Cavani has a towering reputation in the game, stemming from three prolific seasons in Naples which led to his record-breaking move to Paris, but can you think of a really vital game that he has stamped his class all over? To suggest that may seem a little harsh. He came within the width of a goal post at Stamford Bridge of being the undisputed match winner and his bullet header in the first leg in February that gave Laurent Blanc’s side the opportunity to travel to London with parity. Since then, however, Cavani has endured problems and a significant goal drought for one of his talent. Between February 17 and April 5, Cavani went seven matches without scoring and only ended the fallow spell with a double as a substitute in the Coupe de Ligue final on Saturday. PSG won that game 4-0 but had matters sewn up before Cavani came on and helped himself to a double late on (Ibrahimovic had scored twice to give them breathing space); it was his first action since an angry altercation with Blanc a week earlier during a 3-2 win in Marseille. Zlatan Ibrahimovic slides in on Oscar during PSG's second round clash at Chelsea last month . Ibrahimovic is shown the red card for his challenge on Oscar to leave PSG up against it . Ibrahimovic trudges off the field and will miss the first leg of the quarter-final against Barcelona . It has led to speculation about his future in Paris and he has been linked with a number of sides in the Barclays Premier League; Liverpool, for one, would have loved to have signed him last summer but the figures were exorbitant (he earns more per week than Radamel Falcao). Arsenal and Manchester United have also been mentioned with him, while Manchester City tested the water in June 2013 when it was clear that Cavani’s time in Serie A was over; the intensity of his play, you suspect, would enhance his prospects of thriving in the English game. Nasser Al Khelaifi, PSG’s president, maintains one of the jewels in their crown will not be sold this summer but the recent noises Cavani has made have not been ultra-enthusiastic and hint that he might be ready for a new challenge after two years in France. ‘I came to play as a centre-forward with Zlatan and after, things changed for a variety of reasons,’ said Cavani. ‘Everything else is perfect in Paris. The club has behaved very well towards me. I have had some difficult moments personally, and they protected me, supported me. ‘The fans have also always supported me. I think I'm in one of the best places in the world. I'm staying focused on my preparation to give my best for my team, to the club that pays me and has shown faith in me. You never know in football. I'm not thinking about it.’ Tonight his focus will be on Barcelona. With six goals in eight Champions League appearances this season – he averages one every 143 minutes and has created 10 chances for his team-mates – it would be risible to suggest Cavani has something to prove on this stage. That said, it might not be wrong to suggest he needs a big moment. Ibrahimovic’s ability to sprinkle stardust is beyond question, while Veratti is fast becoming one of the finest midfielders in Europe but, without them, PSG need their man from Salto to sparkle. Their prospects depend on him. Louis van Gaal is considering a move for Cavani after seeing Radamel Falcao struggle this season .

Standing on the other side of the pitch will be someone who Suarez knows inside out, a player who hails from his home city in Uruguay and with whom he has shared a number of big nights when representing their country. Edinson Cavani prepares for Paris Saint-Germain's quarter-final clash with Barcelona . PSG train at Camp-des-Loges in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, west of Paris . Cavani celebrates scoring for the Paris side in the League Cup final last weekend . Edinson Cavani knows the spotlight will be shining on him this evening. If Paris Saint-Germain are to break through the glass ceiling and progress beyond the Champions League’s last eight, Cavani – a player known as El Matador – must torment the stars from Catalonia. The onus falls on Cavani for a number of reasons. First, PSG have been stripped by suspension of two key players, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marco Veratti, the product of that ugly last 16 success against Chelsea; Thiago Motta is injured, while David Luiz is also a major doubt. Yet there is more to it than that. Cavani has a towering reputation in the game, stemming from three prolific seasons in Naples which led to his record-breaking move to Paris, but can you think of a really vital game that he has stamped his class all over? To suggest that may seem a little harsh. He came within the width of a goal post at Stamford Bridge of being the undisputed match winner and his bullet header in the first leg in February that gave Laurent Blanc’s side the opportunity to travel to London with parity. Since then, however, Cavani has endured problems and a significant goal drought for one of his talent. Between February 17 and April 5, Cavani went seven matches without scoring and only ended the fallow spell with a double as a substitute in the Coupe de Ligue final on Saturday. PSG won that game 4-0 but had matters sewn up before Cavani came on and helped himself to a double late on (Ibrahimovic had scored twice to give them breathing space); it was his first action since an angry altercation with Blanc a week earlier during a 3-2 win in Marseille. Zlatan Ibrahimovic slides in on Oscar during PSG's second round clash at Chelsea last month . Ibrahimovic is shown the red card for his challenge on Oscar to leave PSG up against it . Ibrahimovic trudges off the field and will miss the first leg of the quarter-final against Barcelona . It has led to speculation about his future in Paris and he has been linked with a number of sides in the Barclays Premier League; Liverpool, for one, would have loved to have signed him last summer but the figures were exorbitant (he earns more per week than Radamel Falcao). Arsenal and Manchester United have also been mentioned with him, while Manchester City tested the water in June 2013 when it was clear that Cavani’s time in Serie A was over; the intensity of his play, you suspect, would enhance his prospects of thriving in the English game. Nasser Al Khelaifi, PSG’s president, maintains one of the jewels in their crown will not be sold this summer but the recent noises Cavani has made have not been ultra-enthusiastic and hint that he might be ready for a new challenge after two years in France. ‘I came to play as a centre-forward with Zlatan and after, things changed for a variety of reasons,’ said Cavani. ‘Everything else is perfect in Paris. The club has behaved very well towards me. I have had some difficult moments personally, and they protected me, supported me. ‘The fans have also always supported me. I think I'm in one of the best places in the world. I'm staying focused on my preparation to give my best for my team, to the club that pays me and has shown faith in me. You never know in football. I'm not thinking about it.’ Tonight his focus will be on Barcelona. With six goals in eight Champions League appearances this season – he averages one every 143 minutes and has created 10 chances for his team-mates – it would be risible to suggest Cavani has something to prove on this stage. That said, it might not be wrong to suggest he needs a big moment. Ibrahimovic’s ability to sprinkle stard","Paris Saint-Germain face Barcelona in the Champions League quarter-final. PSG have been stripped by suspension of two key players, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marco Veratti. Thiago Motta is injured, while David Luiz is also a major doubt. Edinson Cavani knows the spotlight will be shining on him this evening.","So, once again, it will all come down to the actions of a man from Salto. On this occasion, though, the focus will not be on Salto’s most famous son.

"Time fries when you're having fun. Dedicated waitress Judy Eddingfield, 65, celebrated her 50th anniversary working at Winstead's restaurant in Kansas City last week and declares that it's the only job's she's ever had or ever wanted. 'It's like my home away from home and I just love it here,' Eddingfield told Fox. Scroll down for video . Dedicated employee: For most of her life Judy Eddingfield has been employed as a server at Winstead's in Kansas City and says it's the only job she's ever had or ever wanted . Is that you? A staff member at Winstead's said she believes one of the women in this photograph is Judy when she first started working at the restaurant . Classic establishment:  This is a photo of the The Winstead family who own the restaurant showing up for work in 1940 around the time when Judy Eddingfield's mother started working there . Eddingfield says she remembers when French fries and a classic Coca-Cola cost just 65 cents at the same restaurant she's worked at for half-a-century. For Eddingfield, slinging burgers with a smile is a family tradition. On April, 6, 1965 Eddinngfield began working at the restaurant where she was trained by her mother who had already been employed at the establishment for 13 years. Eddingfield said that her first day on the job when she was just 15-years-old she spilled a shake all over a woman's fur coat and thought for sure that she'd be fired. 'The tray tipped over and vanilla malt slid down a lady’s fur coat. I was so embarrassed,' Eddingfield told the Kansas City Star 'Of course, she hollered,' said Eddingfield. All was forgiven after Winstead's, open since 1940, got the coat cleaned. Eddingfield along with many of her siblings continued to provide top notch service. Loves to serve: Judy Eddingfield says that her kind customers are what make her job worthwhile . Lots of love: Winstead's honored Judy Eddingfield last week for her wonderful 50 years of working at the classic burger restaurant . 'I had two brothers, my sister, my mother, two aunts, two cousins and lots of friends that have worked here,' said Eddingfield. 'I was three years old when my mother started here, so I've been eating these burger 60 some years.' Eddingfield says she even met her first husband outside the restaurant and they married 18 months later. The Kansas City Star reports that one of Eddingfield's favorite Winstead’s memories was when Jerry Mathers and Tony Dow of the television series 'Leave It to Beaver' came to eat there in the late 1970's. She said that Mathers was 'talking with his hands' and knocked sent his food flying everywhere. Marriage: Judy Eddingfield even met her true love who she calls 'Frog' at Winstead's and the pair married 18-months-later . Celebration: Dedicated waitress Judy Eddingfield celebrated her 50th anniversary working at Winstead's restaurant in Kansas City last week and declares that it's the only job's she's ever had or ever wanted . 'Leave it to Beaver,' his on-screen brother said jokingly, almost as though it were scripted. On a scarier note, Eddingfield says she once was closing up the restaurant when a man started knocking on the door with a gun. She called 911 and hid in the bathroom until the police arrived. Eddingfield's employees say that as she gets older Eddingfield gets more delightful and that she is always willing to share her knowledge of the business. 'She trained me to be her. Pleasant as she is, prompt. So that people will come here for you and continue to come,' said server Sue Allen who has been there for 13 years. Close knit team: Eddingfield, pictured with some of her coworkers, has a passion for serving food . Nothing's changed!: Winstead's when it first opened in 1940 has an almost identical style to the Winstead's that's here today . Eddingfield's biggest tip she ever received was a generous man who treated his entire staff in 2014 and staff agree it was well deserved. Eddigfield turns 66 on May 13 and though she is getting older, she plans to keep on working as long as she is healthy. When asked why she chose to stay at the establishment for so long, she replied that the customers make her job worthwhile. 'The customers really make it special,' she says. General manager Kathi Fern says that Eddingfield is one of her best employees. 'It's just amazing the way she treats her customers,' said Fern. 'I call her my dinosaur. She's a dying breed and there will never be servers like her again.' said Fern of her dedicated employee.

"In recent years, Iceland has become an increasingly popular filming location with its majestic vistas being prominently featured in many hit TV series or Hollywood blockbusters. Despite the fact that Iceland has been used in filming as far back as 1920, well-known fantasy, sci-fi and action film directors and producers have all descended on the island nation as of late, prompting the quick development of 17 production services companies nationwide. Although the country's many stunning waterfalls and breathtaking glaciers translate beautifully to the silver screen, there are certain filming locations that consistently rank a cut above and are drawing fans of productions such as Game of Thrones, Interstellar or Prometheus. Thingvellir National Park provided the location for the North of Westeros in Game of Thrones . Fans will likely recognise the National Park as the setting of the battle of the Hound and Brienne . The black volcanic landscapes of Svartalfheim provided the filmmakers of Thor: The Dark World with the perfect otherworldly setting, as outlined in this Icelandair infographic. Meanwhile, Clint Eastwood opted to film battle scenes for both Letters from Iwo Jima and Flags of Our Fathers in Iceland – specifically along the dramatic cliffs of the Reykjanes Peninsula, just a quick drive from the capital. Scenes from Christopher Nolan’s epic Interstellar were filmed atop the blue ice glacier Svinafellsjokull in the Skaftafell National Park, which is also located near another favoured filming location: Iceland’s largest glacier, Vatnajokull. The Svinafellsjokull glacier provided a stunning setting for Christopher Nolan's epic film, Interstellar . Interstellar tells the tale of explorers who travel in search of a new planet to sustain the human race . Europe's most powerful waterfall, the Dettifoss, was used in the opening scenes of Prometheus . In Prometheus, the rushing waterfall in the background is meant to help depict the beginning of time . 'Interstellar was my second time filming in Iceland and it was another worldly experience,' the director told Film In Iceland. 'Iceland truly represents the beautiful extremes the nature has to offer.' Not to be left out, Ridley Scott scouted Europe’s most powerful waterfall, the Dettifoss, for the opening scenes depicting the beginning of time in Prometheus. And finally, Game of Thrones enthusiasts will undoubtedly recognise the north of Iceland, namely Thingvellir National Park, from Arya’s storyline and as the setting of the battle of the Hound and Brienne, in the North of Westeros. The Jokullsarlon lake, at the foot of the massive massive Vatnajokull glacier, is another favoured filming spot .","Iceland has become an increasingly popular filming location recently .

Thingvellir National Park provided the location for the North of Westeros in Game of Thrones . Fans will likely recognise the National Park as the setting of the battle of the Hound and Brienne . The black volcanic landscapes of Svartalfheim provided the filmmakers of Thor: The Dark World with the perfect otherworldly setting, as outlined in this Icelandair infographic. Meanwhile, Clint Eastwood opted to film battle scenes for both Letters from Iwo Jima and Flags of Our Fathers in Iceland – specifically along the dramatic cliffs of the Reykjanes Peninsula, just a quick drive from the capital. Scenes from Christopher Nolan’s epic Interstellar were filmed atop the blue ice glacier Svinafellsjokull in the Skaftafell National Park, which is also located near another favoured filming location: Iceland’s largest glacier, Vatnajokull. The Svinafellsjokull glacier provided a stunning setting for Christopher Nolan's epic film, Interstellar . Interstellar tells the tale of explorers who travel in search of a new planet to sustain the human race . Europe's most powerful waterfall, the Dettifoss, was used in the opening scenes of Prometheus . In Prometheus, the rushing waterfall in the background is meant to help depict the beginning of time . 'Interstellar was my second time filming in Iceland and it was another worldly experience,' the director told Film In Iceland. 'Iceland truly represents the beautiful extremes the nature has to offer.' Not to be left out, Ridley Scott scouted Europe’s most powerful waterfall, the Dettifoss, for the opening scenes depicting the beginning of time in Prometheus. And finally, Game of Thrones enthusiasts will undoubtedly recognise the north of Iceland, namely Thingvellir National Park, from Arya’s storyline and as the setting of the battle of the Hound and Brienne, in the North of Westeros. The Jokullsarlon lake, at the foot of the massive massive Vatnajokull glacier, is another favoured filming spot .",Iceland has become an increasingly popular filming location in recent years.

"The family of conjoined twin sisters who died 19 days after they were born have been left mortified after they arrived at their gravesite to find cemetery staff had cleared the baby section of all mementos and tossed them in the rubbish. Faith and Hope Howie were dubbed the miracle twins when they were born on May 8 last year with one body and two faces due to an extremely rare condition known as disrosopus. They died in hospital less than a month after they were born and their parents, Simon Howie and Renee Young, laid them to rest at Pinegrove Memorial Park in Sydney's west. Scroll down for video . Faith and Hope Howie were dubbed the miracle twins when they were born on May 8 last year with one body and two faces due to an extremely rare condition known as disrosopus . Family members have visited the grave every week to leave mementos and flowers for Faith and Hope, but when Mr Howie and Ms Young arrived on Thursday they found the site completely bare. 'We took Renee's aunts to see the girls for the first time and we found everything had been stripped away,' Mr Howie told Daily Mail Australia. 'We were devastated and mortified. We've had a little shrine set up and we've been adding to it since the funeral. 'It's heartbreaking to know we've set this up and it has been treated like rubbish.' Faith and Hope were buried in a pink coffin and their family and friends released doves and pink and white balloons at their funeral. Their family and friends had built up a small memorial with pink and white statues, flowers, pebbles and toys over the past 11 months. When they arrived on Thursday, everything had been removed apart from a bunch of flowers. The twins were buried at Pinegrove Memorial Park in western Sydney after they died after just 19 days. Their family and friends had built a small shrine at their gravesite, which they have added to since the funeral . Family members have visited the grave every week to leave mementos and flowers for Faith and Hope, but when parents Simon Howie and Renee Young arrived on Thursday they found the site completely bare . Faith and Hope's parents confronted staff from the cemetery and were told they were supposed to have been notified they are would be cleaned. They found their daughters' belongings in nearby rubbish bins, but were only able to retrieve about 25 percent of their memorabilia. 'There was no warning, it was just manhandled and thrown in the rubbish. It was through the entire baby section.' The couple retrieved what they could find and returned later in the afternoon to see what else they could salvage - by then everything had been laid out on shelves for people to collect. 'We've gone down there and maintained it. We make sure either side of the girls is clipped with scissors to (workers) don't need to go near it,' Mr Howie said. He said there was no reason for the items to be taken away.

'We pay the money to have the plot, they should be able to just take little mementos. It's just not fair on the families,' Mr Howie said. 'We got to those places to grieve - we're only one month out from the girls turning one... and it's been stripped naked. We have to start again. 'It obviously meant nothing to (the workers). I understand they have a job to do, but this is somebody else's loved one.' Pinegrove has offered an apology to the families affected. Faith and Hope were born with a rare condition called diprosopus, which means they share the same body and organs but have separate brains and two faces . The girls were transferred to Westmead Children's Hospital shortly after their birth on May 8 where they were closely monitored by doctors and nurses . They passed away just 19 days after they were born - their condition was so rare that only 35 cases have ever been recorded and none survived . 'The collection and storage of ornaments, especially photos, should have been handled much more respectfully and our goal is to improve it for the future,' Pinegrove's communication manager Karl Wolfenden said. 'We do understand the emotions of affected families. We have apologised to those we have spoken to and we have invited them to meet so we can find a solution that is agreeable to all. We are inviting other affected families to make contact also. 'Pinegrove is a fresh flower only and no ornamentation park but despite our rules and regulations we should have shown more respect to these items. 'We will discuss and seek an agreeable solution with families in the weeks ahead.' Faith and Hope's parents have set up an online petition to have the rules and regulations at cemetery's changed to ensure memorial items are not removed without being notified. You can find the petition here. Their family and friends had built up a small memorial with pink and white statues, flowers, pebbles and toys in the 11 months since Faith and Hope died .
