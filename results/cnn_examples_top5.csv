"Down Augusta way they say the azaleas are in full bloom, which is more than can be said for England’s Justin Rose. A bruising Florida swing last month saw the Englishman fall outside the world’s top 10. For a player who has been virtually a fixture in the top five for the last three years it was certainly a dent to the ego, with the Masters now just around the corner. Rose’s solution to his miserable form — three missed cuts and a 55th-place finish at the Cadillac Championship in four PGA Tour starts — was the time-honoured one. For the past two weeks, the 34-year-old has spent long hours on the practice ground. Justin Rose hit 17 out of 18 greens in regulation and signed for a 69 at the Shell Houston Open . In the first round of the Shell Houston Open on Thursday there were encouraging signs his decline will prove temporary. Rose hit 17 out of 18 greens in regulation and signed for a 69, the same score as his playing partner, the ever- consistent Jordan Spieth. ‘It’s certainly a welcome return to the sixties, for it had been a while,’ said Rose, smiling. On a day when American Scott Piercy went round in 63 and Phil Mickelson enjoyed his best round in months with a 66, it was hardly surprising the only reporter waiting to talk to Rose was this one. But under the radar is never a bad place to be going to the Masters. The boom and bust years that characterised the first half of Rose’s career meant there was never going to be any feelings of panic following his unusually poor run in the Sunshine State. ‘There’s no doubt I lost my game there but the Florida swing can be unforgiving if you’re slightly off,’ he said. ‘Over the past two weeks I feel like I’ve done some good work and whether I finish well or not here I feel like I’m going in the right direction again. ‘Basically I was getting ahead of the ball at impact, and shots were going left or right, the irons were not solid and the new putter was not working. So we’ve corrected the faults and I’ve gone back to the old putter.’ Phil Mickelson enjoyed his best round in months with a 66 on Thursday . Does he pay much attention to the world rankings? ‘You notice, for sure,’ he said. ‘I’m very proud of the fact I’ve been in the world’s top five for practically the whole of the last three years. It’s a nice ego thing, so by the end of the year I’m hoping there won’t be any slippage. ‘But right now, I’ve got to focus on my game in the knowledge that the rankings change fast when you’re playing well. I’m in all the tournaments I want to be in, so there’s no need to worry on that score. Typically, your good years are built around four or five really good weeks, so you have to stay patient.’ He’d certainly love for one of those good weeks to be the next one. Rose paid a reconnaissance visit to Augusta last Monday and felt the same old thrill. ‘It’s such a treat to enjoy it when it is quiet, you still pinch yourself,’ he said. ‘I think if I’d had a crystal ball when I was 13 or 14 and it had said I’d get to play Augusta every year, I’d have been very happy with that.’ He’s certainly had his share of adventures during his nine appearances to date. Rose might be the only player in Masters history to have led or had a share of the lead after every round bar the last one. His best chance so far of finishing on top after 72 holes came in 2007, when he stood on the 17th hole tied for the lead only to run up a fatal double-bogey six. Paul Casey celebrated his last-gasp Masters invitation with two eagle threes in a fine round of 68 . ‘The Masters has probably been less on my mind this year because I am trying to find some form,’ he admitted. ‘But I think the fact I’ve had a number of great rounds there will always stand me in good stead. Regardless of what happens here, I feel comfortable on that course and know I can manage my game even if it’s not 100 per cent. You draw off the energy of the place.’ Mickelson has certainly done that over the years and perhaps the veteran lefty, a three-time Masters champion, is gearing himself up for another run at the green jacket. ‘It was a good start to the tournament and now I’m looking for three more good rounds,’ he said. 'This is a big week for me. I felt the game was close last week. The only thing missing was chipping and short game.' Paul Casey, like Mickelson another former winner of this event, celebrated his last-gasp Masters invitation with a fine round of 68 notable for two eagle threes. In the afternoon wave, Padraig Harrington and Lee Westwood both made good starts to play their first six holes in two under.","Justin Rose bounced back from Florida misery by carding 69 in Houston .

"There was no special treatment for Lewis Ferguson at Paul Nicholls’ yard on Thursday morning. The 18-year-old was mucking out the stables as usual, just a cut on the nose to show for the fall which has made him an internet sensation. Ferguson, whose double somersault horror fall from the favourite Merrion Square in the 4.20pm at Wincanton on Wednesday has been watched hundreds of thousands of times online. But he was back riding out and said he was undeterred from getting back in the sadal. ‘It was just a blur,’ he said, ‘I couldn’t work out what had happened until I got back to the weighing room and watched the replay. All the other jockeys asked me if I was alright and stuff, they all watched with me and looked away in horror. It’s about the most impressive fall I’ve seen.

It won’t stop me getting back on a course. There’s been no special treatment. ‘My parents who live in the Scottish Borders were worried so I gave them a call so they knew I was ok.

It was only Ferguson’s fifth race and the first time he had fallen although he has fallen a few times riding out. ‘Hopefully the next time I’m on the front page of the newspaper it will be for winning the Gold Cup or the Grand National. I gave the horse a little pat after, not a big one. Given the somersaults, maybe I’ll look at having a gymnastics career after finishing racing.’ Merrion Square was a hotly-tipped favourite to win the 4.20 at Wincanton on Wednesday until the fall .

"When emergency crews received a call saying 'someone' had been knocked down by a car in Essex, they immediately sent two ambulances to the rescue. But the vehicles returned to base just moments later when the caller revealed the 'victim' was actually a squirrel that had been run over in Epping Forest. The report forms just part of a long list released by East of England ambulance service detailing their most bizarre, and irritating, call outs. Two ambulances were sent to Epping Forest after a caller told crews 'someone' had been run down, only for the 'victim' to turn out to be a squirrel. Another man said he had dropped his burger and it was 'bleeding' Another came from reveller in Basildon, Essex, who said 'I've dropped my burger and it is bleeding', while a third woman in Chelmsford, dialled 999 to report 'I've eaten too much takeaway food.' The service said it receives around 2,500 calls per day, and in the last two years has had to deal with 1,248 that did not need emergency help. Front-line crews have attended almost half of the phoney calls, believing them to be genuine emergencies. Also on the list is a woman from  Shoeburyness who called to say she was locked out of the house, while a man in Peterborough called to say his feet hurt after wearing shoes that were too small. In Hitchin, Hertfordshire, a man told 999 staff: 'I have been dieting and feel lethargic.' Gary Morgan, Regional Head of Emergency Operations Centres, asked people to use common-sense when calling, adding that misguided or hoax calls could cost lives. East on England ambulance revealed the bizarre calls as part of a list of 1,248 inappropriate call outs, saying that crew attended half of them, potentially putting lives at risk (file image) He said: 'We're an emergency service and our front-line staff are trained to save lives. 'However, sadly, some of the calls we receive are not even medically related and we will refer hoax calls to the police. 'We prioritise all life-threatening calls to get the quickest possible response. 'However, that response can be affected if our call handlers and front-line staff are dealing with inappropriate 999 calls. 'We would strongly urge people who think it is funny to make a prank call to stop and think about the potential consequences.' In another strange call one woman phoned to say she felt ill after eating too much takeaway, while a man reported that his feet were hurting after wearing shoes that were too tight .","Woman reported 'someone' had been run over, but victim was a squirrel .

"(CNN)Sunday's announcement that Corinthian Colleges Inc. would shut down all of its remaining 28 campuses is a positive development in a long struggle to hold for-profit colleges accountable. Corinthian, which once enrolled more than 70,000 students, is one of the worst of the ""predator colleges"" -- schools that offer dubious degrees, saddle students with high amounts of debt and gobble up tens of billions of dollars in federal money every year. Many of these schools are for-profit career colleges that operate mostly online. It's no wonder that Corinthian is doing this after the U.S. Department of Education curtailed its access to federal student aid last summer. There are about 1.3 million students enrolled in for-profit colleges, many of which have questionable track records, and their students need help transitioning into legitimate postsecondary schools. With Uncle Sam's student loan debt sheet topping $1 trillion, we literally can't afford to continue funding for-profit colleges -- which reportedly get 86% of their funding from federal student loan money. For those not familiar with the for-profit college fiasco, here's the whole story in one telling statistic: While for-profit colleges enroll only 13% of the nation's college students, such colleges account for nearly half of all student loan defaults, according to Department of Education statistics. For comparison's sake, the default rate of for-profit college students is worse than the default rate of the worst subprime borrowers during the financial crisis. How do these colleges operate? It's deviously simple: Convince low-income students into borrowing tens of thousands of dollars through easy federal student loans, keep costs low through online classes and part-time professors, and watch the money roll in. The aggressive tactics of these colleges boggle the mind. Recruiters are told to make 100 phone calls and leave 100 messages a day, according to a ProPublica investigation. I can personally attest to the aggressive tactics. My phone number was accidentally placed on a call list for a for-profit college recently, and I received so many calls per day that I had to ask my wireless carrier to block the phone number. Stopping the exploitation of students isn't easy. The for-profit college business is a multibillion-dollar industry. The CEOs of these companies make millions of dollars a year, employ an army of lobbyists and donate money to both political parties. But the past two months brought a new twist to the crisis. Hundreds of graduates of the now-defunct Corinthian joined a ""debt strike,"" publicly declaring their refusal to pay back their loans. In response, Education Department Secretary Arne Duncan signaled a willingness to forgive loans of Corinthian graduates who have crushing debt and no job prospects. Now that Corinthian is finally shutting down, we must finish the job. The remaining for-profit colleges should be closed. Any student not gainfully employed or transferred to a reputable college within three years should be considered a victim, and their debts should be forgiven. Yes, ""victim"" is the right word. If these degrees actually helped people get jobs, we should be celebrating them. But according to a jaw-dropping report by the Education Department, the average graduate of an online for-profit college makes less than a high school dropout. Not the equivalent of a high school dropout. Less than a high school dropout. The real-life misery caused by predatory colleges is painful to hear about. One Corinthian graduate has $37,000 in debt for his computer science degree, but he can't even get a job at Best Buy, according to Slate. Another graduate, $33,000 in debt, has a medical assisting degree, but she gave up on finding employment in her field. She waits tables now, The Chronicle of Higher Education says. I can already hear your next question. If for-profit colleges are this terrible, are they at least cheaper? No. In fact, their cost is reportedly around 60% higher than a comparable degree from a public college. What's even more frustrating is that we've known about the shenanigans of these predator colleges for years. A 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office found widespread rule breaking by the largest for-profit colleges -- everything from accepting fictitious high-school diplomas to encouraging plagiarism and cheating. In one example, an undercover federal investigator posing as a student was told by a professor, ""It's not hard to get a 100% on the second try; just jot down the correct answers and take the quiz again,"" according to The New York Times. In 2013, Career Education Corp. paid $10 million to settle charges by the state of New York regarding phony job-placement claims. All told, no fewer than 36 state attorneys general were investigating for-profit colleges in 2014. After selling off 95 of its campuses last year, Corinthian said on Sunday that it tried unsuccessfully to sell the remaining 28 campuses, blaming the failure on ""federal and state regulators seeking to impose financial penalties and conditions"" on potential buyers. You can't hide your bad behavior forever, and the questionable practices of many for-profit colleges are starting to catch up with them. Enrollment at the University of Phoenix -- the largest for-profit college in the United States -- has fallen by half, to about 213,000. We laid the smackdown on predatory lenders during the financial crisis, and it's time to do the same thing with for-profit colleges. To keep predator colleges from wrecking our faith in the college degree -- still the best pathway to a middle-class life -- we need to act now. For-profit colleges have flunked their final exam. Now it's up to their rich benefactor, Uncle Sam, to make sure they don't go back to school in the fall. Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article said the San Diego campus of the University of Phoenix had been banned from enrolling military veterans last year; that issue has been resolved.","David Wheeler: Corinthian, considered a ""predator"" school, will shut down campuses .
