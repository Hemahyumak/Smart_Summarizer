"The sanctions freeze the US assets of those affected, and stop US entities from doing business with them.
Those targeted include the interior minister and the head of the army.
Last week, President Donald Trump vowed ""strong and swift economic actions"" if Mr Maduro held the poll, due on Sunday.
""Who do these imperialists in the United States think they are?"" Mr Maduro said on Wednesday. ""The government of the world?""
He also called the sanctions ""illegal, insolent and unprecedented"".
The vote, which Venezuela says will proceed as planned, is to choose the 545 members of a new constituent assembly that would rival the opposition-held National Assembly.
Critics say the president is trying to cement a dictatorship. He argues it is the only way to bring peace back to the divided nation.
The US sanctions also target the head of Venezuela's National Electoral Council, Tibisay Lucena, and former vice president Elías Jaua, who is leading the presidential commission organising Sunday's vote.
The inclusion of senior figures from the state oil company PDVSA underlines a further threat from Washington that sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector could be next.
Announcing the sanctions, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the US ""will not ignore the Maduro regime's ongoing efforts to undermine democracy, freedom, and the rule of law"".
""Anyone elected to the National Constituent Assembly should know that their role in undermining democratic processes and institutions in Venezuela could expose them to potential US sanctions,"" he said.
Mr Maduro has accused the US of stoking unrest against his government, but President Trump said last week that Washington ""will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles"".
A 48-hour general strike is currently under way in Venezuela, in protest at the planned vote.
A 30-year-old man was killed on Wednesday at a protest in Ejido, in the western state of Mérida. The cause of his death was not initially given.
More than 100 people have been killed in protest-related violence, since almost daily anti-government protests began on 1 April.
The unrest has further hammered an imploding economy that is running short of food and medicine.
Venezuela's opposition is refusing to take part in the elections for the assembly, which it says is a tool for Mr Maduro to entrench himself in power.
On Tuesday, opposition leader Leopoldo López called on Venezuelans to step up street protests, saying the president's plan to rewrite the constitution would bring an end to the country's democracy.
Speaking from his home, where he is held under house arrest, he called on the military to withdraw its support from the government.
""I invite you to not be accomplices to the annihilation of the republic, to a constitutional fraud, to repression,"" he said in a video posted on Twitter [in Spanish].
Demonstrations and a 24-hour strike held last week seem only to have hardened the government's resolve to go ahead with the election.
But the opposition says it is confident it will be able to shut down most of the country until Friday, when a massive demonstration has been scheduled in the capital, Caracas.",The US government has imposed sanctions on 13 senior Venezuelan officials as pressure mounts on President Nicolás Maduro ahead of a controversial vote for a new constituent assembly.,"The sanctions freeze the US assets of those affected, and stop US entities from doing business with them.

"Rajab, who heads the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR), was convicted in 2012 of taking part in illegal gatherings and disturbing public order.
An appeals court later reduced his original three-year term by a year.
He was one of several leading activists arrested by the authorities after pro-democracy protests erupted in 2011.
Soon after his release on Saturday, Rajab told the Associated Press news agency that he was happy to be out after spending more than 600 days in prison.
He also appealed for the release of all political prisoners, the agency added.
Rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights First, have campaigned on behalf of Rajab throughout his prison sentence, calling on the authorities to release him.
In December 2013, a Bahraini court rejected a request by Rajab's lawyers for early release. They argued that he was eligible because he had already served three-quarters of a two-year sentence.
In addition to his role with the BCHR, Mr Rajab is deputy secretary general of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH).
Before his imprisonment in July 2012, Mr Rajab was repeatedly detained in connection with the pro-democracy protests that erupted in the Gulf kingdom the previous year.
Amnesty said that he was punched in the face several times by riot police as he led a demonstration in February 2012, and in May 2012 was charged with ""insulting a national institution"" in comments about the interior ministry he posted on Twitter.
In June 2012, Rajab was sentenced to three months in jail over different tweets he wrote about the prime minister. The conviction was eventually overturned on appeal, but only after he had begun his two-year sentence for taking part in unauthorised protests.
At his trial, Mr Rajab told the court that he had been held in dire conditions and subjected to ill treatment, including being placed in solitary confinement with a dead animal and kept almost naked.

The 34-year-old beat three-time champion Tony Martin by 26.23 seconds on a hilly 47.1km course in Spain.
After finishing second to Martin in 2011 and 2013, Wiggins finally has a rainbow jersey on the road to go with the six he has won on the track.
""I knew coming into it that I had the legs,"" Wiggins said afterwards.
""Once I saw the course I realised if I was ever going to beat Tony again it was on a course like this.
""It's been an up and down year - obviously I didn't ride the Tour de France. I want to dedicate this to my family because they had to put up with me when I was at home in July.
""It's my last Road World Championships and I've finished with a gold medal.""
Martin trailed Wiggins by 9.64 seconds at the final time-check and the Briton extended his lead in the final 12km.
Wiggins clocked 56 minutes 25.52 seconds to claim a convincing win over Germany's Martin, who was chasing a fourth-successive title. Tom Dumoulin of the Netherlands finished third.
""I knew it would be difficult on the final loop, but I paced it perfectly and still had pace in the final few kilometres,"" Wiggins explained.
""On my last descent, I heard on the radio that I was 10 seconds up but I pushed all the way to the line because I did not want to take any risks.""
Wiggins collapsed to the ground in exhaustion at the finish line but recovered to raise his thumb in celebration when Martin crossed the line.
Victory in north-west Spain gives the 2012 Tour de France winner a world time trial title to go with his three national titles and gold at the London Olympics in the discipline.
""To add the world title is just fantastic. Now I've got the set,"" added Wiggins.
It is the perfect end to a patchy year on the road and track for Wiggins, who won the Tour of California in May, but then missed out on Team Sky selection for the Tour de France and had to settle for silver in the velodrome in the team pursuit at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games.
His success means he becomes the first British male rider to take world time trial gold since Chris Boardman in the inaugural race in 1994.  Emma Pooley was the last British female to win gold in the event in 2010.
Wiggins has announced that he intends to return to the track for the Rio Olympics in 2016 and also hopes to attempt to break the hour record set by Germany's Jens Voigt last week.

"All but one Welsh council had resettled refugees from the UK government's Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme by the end of last December.

The charity's Matthew Hemsley said: ""Wales has a proud history of welcoming those in need and it is important to see that tradition being continued.""
The majority of the refugees in Wales were taken in the second half of 2016 - 285.

In August 2016, it was reported that only nine of Wales 22 councils had taken part up to the end of June.

"His daughter said he had died at Val de Grace military hospital in Paris on Tuesday evening.
Raymond Aubrac and his late wife Lucie became important members of Jean Moulin's underground Resistance movement in 1942.
Aubrac was arrested in June 1943 with Moulin, who died after torture.
In a recent BBC interview, he described how their arrests by the Gestapo at a doctor's surgery in the suburb of Caluire in Lyon had come as ""a shock but not a surprise"".
Jean Moulin, who had been sent by Gen Charles de Gaulle to organise the underground resistance to Nazi occupation, was tortured, taken to Paris and later died on a train to Berlin.
But Raymond Aubrac escaped when a group of fighters including his wife attacked a lorry moving him and other members of the Resistance from jail in Lyon.
Born as Raymond Samuel in 1914, Aubrac was Jewish.
He studied engineering and married Lucie Bernard after war broke out. After his escape from jail, the couple reached London in February 1944.
Their story and their Resistance work with Jean Moulin became legendary in France and the couple gave a number of talks to schools and colleges about their experience.
After France was liberated, Aubrac was given the task of supervising reconstruction efforts in the port city of Marseille. From 1964-75 he served as a director at the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome.
He twice gave evidence after the war against Rene Hardy, a fellow Resistance member who was accused of betraying his colleagues but was later acquitted.
In 2010, he travelled to London with President Nicolas Sarkozy to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Gen de Gaulle's appeal to the French people after the country had fallen to the Nazis.
Raymond Aubrac remained politically active until he died and gave his backing to Socialist presidential candidate Francois Hollande.
In tribute, President Sarkozy described him as an ""heroic figure"" whose ""escape, thanks to the courage of his wife Lucie Aubrac, has entered into the legend of Resistance history"".
Centrist presidential candidate Francois Bayrou praised him as a ""major emblematic figure"".","One of the leading figures of the French resistance against the Nazis, Raymond Aubrac, has died aged 97, his family says.","His daughter said he had died at Val de Grace military hospital in Paris on Tuesday evening.

After France was liberated, Aubrac was given the task of supervising reconstruction efforts in the port city of Marseille. From 1964-75 he served as a director at the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome.
He twice gave evidence after the war against Rene Hardy, a fellow Resistance member who was accused of betraying his colleagues but was later acquitted.
In 2010, he travelled to London with President Nicolas Sarkozy to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Gen de Gaulle's appeal to the French people after the country had fallen to the Nazis.
Raymond Aubrac remained politically active until he died and gave his backing to Socialist presidential candidate Francois Hollande.
In tribute, President Sarkozy described him as an ""heroic figure"" whose ""escape, thanks to the courage of his wife Lucie Aubrac, has entered into the legend of Resistance history"".
Centrist presidential candidate Francois Bayrou praised him as a ""major emblematic figure"".","Raymond Aubrac, a French Resistance fighter who escaped from Nazi concentration camps during World War Two, has died at the age of 100.","His daughter said he had died at Val de Grace military hospital in Paris on Tuesday evening. Raymond Aubrac and his late wife Lucie became important members of Jean Moulin's underground Resistance movement in 1942. Aubrac was arrested in June 1943 with Moulin, who died after torture."
"Paula Palmer said jewellery given to her by husband Dennis on their wedding day was among the items stolen from the house in Barnett Road, Brighton.
""It's devastating to think people can do that,"" she said. ""I am numb.""
Mrs Palmer said she believed the thieves knew where the occupants of the house were when the break-in happened on Friday evening.
""We were waiting outside for the hearse to come for a good 20 minutes,"" she said.
""It doesn't take long for people to know what you are doing.""
She said she knew something was wrong when she returned home with a group of people.
""By the time I reached the top of the stairs I could see the devastation in the main bedroom,"" she said.
""My husband's jewellery box was broken open, the wardrobe doors were open and all drawers tipped out.
""I was numb anyway from burying my husband - but to come back, to that I was speechless.""
The stolen jewellery included gold earrings, necklaces and bracelets.
The thieves also took the keys to Mrs Palmer's grey Kia Ce'ed car, registration BJ09 YBK, and drove it away from the front of the house.
""It is quite brazen and quite unusual for people to walk out of the front door, get in the car and drive off,"" said Det Con Richard Valder-Davies.

"Mourinho has been cleared of making discriminatory comments to Carneiro, who has since left the club.
But Dyke, in a letter to FA Council members, said the 52-year-old Portuguese ""made a mistake"".
The FA has been criticised by one of its board members - Heather Rabbatts - for its handling of the case.
Rabbatts, head of the FA's inclusion advisory board, said the governing body's reaction had been ""seriously disappointing"".
""I have major concerns over the way in which the disciplinary process has been conducted,"" she added.
The FA investigated after a member of public made a complaint about Mourinho's language towards Carneiro during Chelsea's 2-2 draw with Swansea on 8 August.
Carneiro and head physio Jon Fearn had treated Eden Hazard for an injury after being called onto the pitch by the referee, which meant the player had to leave the field.
That meant Chelsea were reduced to nine men, with goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois having been sent off, and Mourinho criticised the pair in a post-match news conference.
Carneiro, 42, had her role downgraded before deciding to leave the club.
""I don't think Mr Mourinho comes well out of the whole saga - he clearly made a mistake in the heat of a game, and should have said so and apologised,"" said FA chairman Dyke.
""Instead he has said very little and Miss Carneiro has lost her job.
""Our regulatory team have investigated this and whilst Mr Mourinho has breached no rules, it was clearly a failure of his personal judgement and public behaviour.""
The Women in Football campaign group said its language expert is certain Mourinho used abusive language, contrary to the verdict of the FA's chosen expert.
But the FA said it had appointed an independent academic expert in Portuguese linguistics to study the footage of the incident, which included the audio recording.
""We have engaged an expert of high calibre to address such an important issue such as discriminatory language, which we take very seriously,"" said a spokesperson.
Rabbatts said the FA had failed to act previously over sexist and abusive chanting towards Carneiro by fans in stadiums.","Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho should have apologised to ex-club doctor Eva Carneiro for his criticism of her, says Football Association boss Greg Dyke.","Mourinho has been cleared of making discriminatory comments to Carneiro, who has since left the club.

"It happened early on Sunday morning at a private party in San Jose's Fiesta nightclub, near San Francisco.
Police have confirmed the Grammy winner was unhurt.
Mobile phone footage said to be of the gig has been posted online and shots can be heard in the middle of one of Brown's songs.
In a video, posted on his own Vine profile, he can be seen looking at something going on in the crowd before shots ring out.

It says it is still investigating the ""motive surrounding the shootings"" and ""several people have been detained by officers"".
The singer has made no public comment on the shooting.
According to the newspaper the San Jose Mercury News, shortly afterwards he tweeted ""I'm 100"" to tell fans he was uninjured, but that tweet was later deleted.

"In laboratory tests, two sweetgrass compounds drove mosquitoes away from tantalising fake blood samples, just as well as the widely-used repellent Deet.
Further tests are needed to see how long the effects last.
The researchers say folk remedies are a rich source of possible new repellents.
""This is the fourth plant that we've investigated in this manner,"" said Charles Cantrell, a research chemist who works for the US Department of Agriculture.
""The neat thing about this one is that it produces a compound, coumarin, which has a great odour and was known... to have some repelling properties. And it's very safe.""
Dr Cantrell was speaking in Boston at the 250th national meeting of the American Chemical Society.
""There's an interesting story about coumarin,"" he told journalists at the conference.
""Back in the 90s, Avon 'Skin So Soft' had a product that people discovered actually worked well as an insect repellent. It wasn't marketed as an insect repellent, but the effectiveness was well-known among consumers.
""Scientists did an investigation and one of the constituents in Skin So Soft was coumarin - which we've now isolated from sweetgrass.""
Despite this, coumarin is not currently registered or marketed as a repellent, Dr Cantrell said.
The second key ingredient he and his colleagues identified in sweetgrass was phytol, a common constituent in essential oils from plants. Phytol, similarly, is known to repel insects but is not currently marketed for that purpose.
Dr Cantrell's team isolated these chemicals from the grass by passing steam through it, separating the oily and volatile compounds and then further purifying them into 12 fractions.
Those 12 samples were presented to mosquitoes in a special test.
""The bioassay is designed to mimic human skin,"" Dr Cantrell explained. ""You put a blood mimic in a little well and cover it with a membrane.""
That membrane is then perfumed with the chemical to be tested, and the researchers simply count the bites.
""We'll have five mosquitoes per little chamber. You can watch them bite the membrane, but for final confirmation... you squash them, to see which ones contain the red dye.""
Once these results were in, the team identified the specific molecules involved using spectrometry.
Coumarin and phytol were the stand-outs, Dr Cantrell said.
""In this three minute time-frame, measuring the number of bites, they were just as effective as Deet.""
The next step is to test them over a more practical timeframe.
""We don't know yet what the duration of repellency is. It may work well in our bioassay for three minutes, but how does it work for three hours?

"Renfe chief Julio Gomez-Pomar was speaking to a parliamentary panel about the crash near Santiago de Compostela.
The derailment on 24 July also left about 170 people injured.
Train driver Francisco Jose Garzon Amo is under investigation but has not been formally charged.
""Throughout the journey there is no record of communication from the train to the monitoring centre to report any damage or abnormality,"" Mr Gomez-Pomar said.
He said all normal security procedures had been followed and that the driver had not been on duty more than the standard number of hours, having just returned to work after two days off.
The BBC's Guy Hedgecoe in Madrid says the parliamentary session is not expected to look at the causes of the accident.
Instead, MPs want to know what measures have been taken since then to improve safety.
The train's ""black box"" data recorder has revealed that Mr Garzon was talking to a colleague on his work phone and consulting documents just before the derailment.
Judicial authorities have said the train was travelling at 192km/h (119mph) - more than twice the speed limit - on the bend where it derailed.
All eight carriages careered off the tracks on the express route between Madrid and the port city of Ferrol on the Galician coast.
The Renfe chief said that on the day of the crash the train had undergone a thorough technical inspection and nothing abnormal had been found. The brakes were in perfect condition, he said.
In addition, he said there were three warning signs on the line telling drivers about the bend near Santiago de Compostela where the train derailed and where the speed limit was 80km/h.
Mr Gomez-Pomar said that under Renfe's rules drivers are banned from sending text messages during journeys, they can only use their work phone if strictly necessary and are not allowed to make calls on their personal phone.
Spain's Minister of Public Works Ana Pastor will address the panel on Friday and announce extra measures to prevent such accidents in future, the Renfe chief said.",The head of Spain's public railways says the crew of the train which derailed at high speed last month killing 79 people had not reported any problems before the crash.,"Renfe chief Julio Gomez-Pomar was speaking to a parliamentary panel about the crash near Santiago de Compostela.

"Michael McConville told the BBC he took Mr Adams' remarks ""as a threat"".
Asked about Mr McConville's allegation, Mr Adams said: ""I didn't say that.""
He was released without charge on Sunday after being questioned for four days about the 1972 killing.
The Sinn Féin president claimed there was a ""sustained, malicious, untruthful campaign"" against him.
It is believed police had wanted to charge Mr Adams with IRA membership.
It is likely that police would have considered such a charge before he was released on Sunday night, but did not have sufficient evidence for a reasonable prospect of prosecution.
Jean McConville, a 37-year-old widow and mother-of-10, was abducted from her Belfast home, shot and secretly buried. Her body was found on a beach in County Louth in 2003.
She was kidnapped from her home in Divis Flats in west Belfast in front of her children after being wrongly accused of being an informer for the British Army.
Her son Michael said his family would fight ""to the bitter end"" for justice.
He said he had met Mr Adams around the time that the then Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman Nuala O'Loan was drawing up a report that would go on to dismiss claims Mrs McConville was an informer.
Mr McConville said: ""Gerry Adams says to me, 'Michael, you are getting a letter of support from the republican people'.
""He says 'if you release the names I hope you are ready for the backlash' - I took it as a threat.""
Mr Adams denied making such a comment.
""If Michael McConville wants to give names, he should do so - that's entirely his right,"" he said.
Mr Adams, the former MP for West Belfast and current representative for County Louth in the Irish parliament, presented himself for interview by prior arrangement with detectives on Wednesday night.
He was then arrested under the terrorism act for questioning about the IRA murder of Mrs McConville.
BBC News understands there was insufficient evidence to charge Mr Adams with any offence.
The Sinn Fein president was questioned for four days in connection with the murder of Jean McConville and membership of the IRA.
He has strongly denied all those allegations.
A file will be sent to the public prosecution service in Northern Ireland later this week but it is thought that unless significant new evidence comes to light, he will not face any charge.
Speaking at a news conference in Belfast following his release, Mr Adams said he had contacted Northern Ireland police two months ago about the McConville case.
He questioned the timing of his arrest in the middle of an election campaign and claimed they could have used discretion rather than ""pernicious, coercive legislation"" to deal with the matter.
He again said he was innocent of any involvement in Mrs McConville's murder.
He said Sinn Féin remained fully committed to the political process in Northern Ireland. ""The IRA is gone, it's finished,"" he said.
""I want to make it clear that I support the PSNI.""
Northern Ireland Justice Minister David Ford said he ""saw no reason"" why Mr Adams' release without charge would damage confidence in the police.
""With the way that Northern Ireland politics operates, there is never a good time to do anything - if it had been before Christmas it would have been the Haass talks; as soon as the election campaign is over, people would be talking about a difficult marching season,"" said the Alliance Party leader.
""You could always produce an excuse for the police not to do their duty at any time.""
The decision to release Mr Adams means that prosecution lawyers will decide if charges will be brought.
The file sent by the police to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) will detail the evidence gathered.
It will be up to PPS lawyers to decide if there is enough evidence to bring any charges and what those charges would be.
The test for prosecution is met if there is sufficient evidence that can be admitted in court to provide a reasonable prospect of conviction. Lawyers must also decide if the prosecution is required in the public interest.
It could take some time for police to prepare the file for the PPS, with prosecutors then taking a further period to assess whatever evidence is presented.
Meanwhile,  one of Mrs McConville's daughters, Helen McKendry, has said she is hopeful that the family will raise the money to take a civil case against the Sinn Fein president for the murder of her mother.
Last month, Ivor Bell, 77, a leader in the Provisional IRA in the 1970s, was charged with aiding and abetting the murder, and there have also been a number of other arrests recently.
The case against Mr Bell is based on an interview he allegedly gave to researchers at Boston College in the US.
The Boston College tapes are a series of candid, confessional interviews with former loyalist and republican paramilitaries, designed to be an oral history of the Troubles.
One of the academics involved at the outset of the project said it had been ""a car crash"".
Lord Bew of Queen's University, Belfast, said: ""I think that one of the sad things is that, first of all most importantly, not one whit of improvement has occurred for those who have suffered during the Troubles.
""Academically, there is a freeze now around all similar projects and that has to be regretted.""","A son of Jean McConville has said Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams warned him several years ago there would be a ""backlash"" if he released the names of those he believed killed her.","Michael McConville told the BBC he took Mr Adams' remarks ""as a threat"".
Asked about Mr McConville's allegation, Mr Adams said: ""I didn't say that.""
He was released without charge on Sunday after being questioned for four days about the 1972 killing.
The Sinn Féin president claimed there was a ""sustained, malicious, untruthful campaign"" against him.
It is believed police had wanted to charge Mr Adams with IRA membership.
It is likely that police would have considered such a charge before he was released on Sunday night, but did not have sufficient evidence for a reasonable prospect of prosecution.
Jean McConville, a 37-year-old widow and mother-of-10, was abducted from her Belfast home, shot and secretly buried. Her body was found on a beach in County Louth in 2003.
She was kidnapped from her home in Divis Flats in west Belfast in front of her children after being wrongly accused of being an informer for the British Army.
Her son Michael said his family would fight ""to the bitter end"" for justice.
He said he had met Mr Adams around the time that the then Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman Nuala O'Loan was drawing up a report that would go on to dismiss claims Mrs McConville was an informer.
Mr McConville said: ""Gerry Adams says to me, 'Michael, you are getting a letter of support from the republican people'.
""He says 'if you release the names I hope you are ready for the backlash' - I took it as a threat.""
Mr Adams denied making such a comment.
""If Michael McConville wants to give names, he should do so - that's entirely his right,"" he said.
Mr Adams, the former MP for West Belfast and current representative for County Louth in the Irish parliament, presented himself for interview by prior arrangement with detectives on Wednesday night.
He was then arrested under the terrorism act for questioning about the IRA murder of Mrs McConville.
BBC News understands there was insufficient evidence to charge Mr Adams with any offence.
